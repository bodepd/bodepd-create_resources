create_resources

This is the create_resources module.

*NOTE* - this has been accepted into 2.7.x core, I am publishing it seperately 
so that it can be used with 2.6.x

  This function allows you to dynamically generate resources,
  passing them as a hash to the create_resources function.
  
  This was originally written to be used together with an ENC.
  
  Resources can be programitally generated as yaml and passed to a class.
  
  classes:
    webserver::instances:
      instances:
        instance1:
          foo: bar
        instance2:
          foo: blah
  
  Then puppet code can consume the hash parameters and convert then into resources
  
  class webserver::instances (
    $instances = {}
  ) {
    create_resources('webserver::instance', $instances)
  }
  
  Now I can dynamically determine how webserver instances are deployed to nodes
  by updating the YAML files.
